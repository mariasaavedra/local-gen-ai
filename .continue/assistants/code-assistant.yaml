    description: Summarize the architecture, structure, and major responsibilities of this codebase.
    prompt: |
      You are a senior staff engineer onboarding to this codebase. Your task is to provide a high-level summary of the project structure.

      Please:
      - Identify the main purpose of the codebase.
      - Break down the major folders and files by function (e.g., "auth", "API layer", "frontend components", etc.).
      - Highlight patterns, tech stack (NestJS, Prisma, GraphQL, etc.), and architectural choices.
      - Use Markdown headers to organize your explanation.
      - Be concise and avoid regurgitating code unless necessary to illustrate a point.
    rules:
      - Avoid speculation—only summarize what's visible.
      - Use concise technical language.
      - If unsure about purpose, say so explicitly.
      - Group related files/folders together.
